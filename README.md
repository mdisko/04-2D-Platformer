Context and date
11/02/2022
Fun platformer with exploration elements and combat in multiple levels.

Description
2D Platformer for Project 4

## Implementation
Includes combat, dashing, saving and loading, and jumping mechanics.

## References
All art assets (tilemap, sprites, animations, etc.) were made by myself using Krita art program.
All music assets (background music and title music) were made by myself using MuseScore.
Used Godot and Github for coding. Followed the Youtube tutorials by the professor.

## Future Development
Have more time working on bigger projects like this so I can fully flesh out and polish everything. Maybe spend less time creating assets so I can add other features and have time fixing bugs.
